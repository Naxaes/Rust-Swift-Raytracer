* Differentiate between primitives and collection of primitives


* Remove material and normals from primitives.
    A raytracer will most of the time just iterate over the primitives
    position and the data relevant for determining a hit. Many of these
    hits will be discarded as we find objects closer to us. Instead,
    make a parallel list for extra data.

        spheres   = [Sphere(id: u32, position: Vec3, radius: f32), ...]
        triangles = [Triangle(id: u32, v0: Vec3, v1: Vec3, v2: Vec3), ...]

        hits = [id: u32, id: u32, ...]

        materials = [Material(...), ...]
        mapping : id -> material_index
